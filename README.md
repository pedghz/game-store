**Project Information:**

**Name of the project: wsd17-Django Unchained**

**Communication Application: djangounchained-group.slack.com**

**Version control system: https://gitlab.rd.tut.fi/ghazi/Web\_development\_project.git**

**Scope of the project:**

The objective of the project is to implement a game store where players can play their favorite online games and developers can upload games to the store.

For this project, we plan to implement the following features:

- Create an authentication system so that players and developers may login, logout and register,
- The players will have the possibility to buy and explore games. They will also be able to check high-scores and save their own high-scores (provide some game-service interaction),
- The developers will be allowed to upload games to their inventory and see the list of game sales,

**Detail of functionalities:**

We will now give more details about the different points:

The authentication system will use an email validation scheme to make sure that new users are real.

For paying games, we will use a mockup payment service. Having to buy games implies that players may only play games they purchased. The exploration of games may be done through a search bar.

Deletion and update of games may be done by the developer. The developer should also have the ability to see his selling statistics.

As for security restrictions, we will make sure that developers are only allowed to modify, delete and add their own games (modify their own inventory).

As for additional functionalities, we will update this document as we advance.

For the functionalities, since we are just starting in the field, we only know that we will be using Javascript, HTML/CSS and Django plus one or two third-party APIs. As a result, we will enrich this part later on i.e when we start doing actual coding.

**Organization of the groupwork**

The organization of the groupwork will be done as follows: we will meet on a weekly basis to keep each other up to date. During the week, we will communicate through Slack where we already created a group. As for, version control, since our repository is in Gitlab, we will be using Git.
